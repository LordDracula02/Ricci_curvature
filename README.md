# Ricci_curvature
Foreman-Ricci curvature is a discrete version of the classical Ricci curvature from differential geometry, adapted for networks and discrete structures, as it measures the deviation of a space from being Eclidean, specifically along the tangent vectors(which corresponds to edges in the given networks)

Now coming to the key properties of the Forman-Ricci curvature:

-> In networks, Forman_Ricci curvature quantifies how the network spreads out at the ends of the edges

-> So, the more negative the curvature value, the more the network spreads out

-> It captures the geodesic dispersal propertes of the classical Ricci curvature

-> it applies to a broad class of the geometric objects i.e. weighted cell complexes


There are 4 types of networks and in this problem use case we are calculating the curvature values for each node for a Directed network which is shown below.

the final network grpah with calculated Ricci curvature values for each node is shown down below.
